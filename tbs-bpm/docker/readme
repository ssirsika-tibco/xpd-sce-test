Product Name:    TIBCO Business Studio™ - Cloud BPM Edition 
Docker Configuration for Automated CI/CD
Release Version: 5.0.0
Release Date:    October 2019
================================================================================
The Docker image does not come as part of the TIBCO Business Studio - Cloud 
BPM Edition installation. Instead, it is necessary to build the Docker 
image on-site. To create the Docker image you will need to install Docker 
on your machine, and include it in the path.

Once Docker is installed, open a shell prompt and navigate to the TIBCO 
Business Studio - Cloud BPM Edition Docker installer folder 
(<TIBCO Studio Home>/docker_cicd).

You will require the Linux x86_64 version of the TIBCO Business Studio Cloud 
BPM Edition Installer 
(e.g. TIB_business-studio-cloud-bpm-edition_5.0.0_linux24gl23_x86_64.zip).

You can copy the TIBCO Business Studio - Cloud BPM Edition installer to the 
folder <TIBCO Studio Home>/docker_cicd/image_template or pass its full file path 
to the build script.

To build the Docker image use the following command:

Windows:
build-image.bat [<studio-installer>]

Linux:
./build-image.sh [<studio-installer>]

where:
  <studio-installer> is the full path of the Linux TIBCO Business Studio - Cloud 
  BPM Edition Installer file. This is optional if you have already copied the 
  file to the image_template folder.

================================================================================
IMPORTANT

Building the docker image requires the download and installation of software
under LGPL license.
If you accept this download and license (see ./licenses/lgpl-license.txt) then
you should add the parameter –acceptLGPL to the command line described above.
