
The docker image does not come as part of the Studio installation. Instead, it
is necessary to build the docker image on-site. To create the docker image
you will need to install docker on your machine, and include it in the path.

Once docker is installed, open a shell prompt and navigate to the Studio docker
installer folder (<TIBCO Studio Home>/docker_cicd).

You will require the Linux x86_64 version of the Studio Installer
(e.g. TIB_business-studio-cloud-bpm-edition_5.0.0_linux24gl23_x86_64.zip).

You can copy the Studio Installer to the folder 
    <TIBCO Studio Home>/docker_cicd/image_template
or pass its full file path to the build script.

To build the docker image use the following command:

Windows:
build-image.bat [<studio-installer>]

Linux:
./build-image.sh [<studio-installer>]

where:
  <studio-installer> is the full path of the Linux Studio Installer file. This
  is optional if you have already copied the file to the image_template folder.
