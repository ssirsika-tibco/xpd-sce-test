Product Name:    TIBCO Business Studioâ„¢ Cloud BPM Edition - Docker Configuration 
for Automated CI/CD
Release Version: 5.0.0
Release Date:    October 2019
================================================================================
The Docker image does not come as part of the TIBCO Business Studio Cloud 
BPM Edition installation. Instead, it is necessary to build the Docker 
image on-site. To create the Docker image you will need to install Docker 
on your machine, and include it in the path.

Once Docker is installed, open a shell prompt and navigate to the TIBCO 
Business Studio Cloud BPM Edition Docker installer folder 
(<TIBCO Studio Home>/docker_cicd).

You will require the Linux x86_64 version of the TIBCO Business Studio Cloud 
BPM Edition Installer
(e.g. TIB_business-studio-cloud-bpm-edition_5.0.0_linux24gl23_x86_64.zip).

You can copy the TIBCO Business Studio Cloud BPM Edition installer to the folder 
    <TIBCO Studio Home>/docker_cicd/image_template
or pass its full file path to the build script.

To build the Docker image use the following command:

Windows:
build-image.bat [<studio-installer>]

Linux:
./build-image.sh [<studio-installer>]

where:
  <studio-installer> is the full path of the Linux TIBCO Business Studio Cloud 
  BPM Edition Installer file. This is optional if you have already copied the 
  file to the image_template folder.
