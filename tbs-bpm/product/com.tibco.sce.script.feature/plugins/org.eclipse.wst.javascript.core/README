Note from Jan Arciuchiewicz 26 March 2012 
------------------------------------
This plug-in is provided by the Eclipse Foundation project. It use to be a part of WST 
eclipse project, but WST project was redesign, the plug-n was excluded and the functionality 
replaced by set of com.eclipse.wst.jdt* plug-ins.
However as far as I can tell plug-in project is internal to com.tibco.xpd.script.feature feature.

Given that no other TIBCO project requires this plug-in the most 
appropriate temporary solution appears to be to include it within the SCRIPT feature, for 
now at least. In order to work within the constraints of 'Builder' it is necessary to place 
this plug-in under source control. In the future this reliance on this plug-in should be 
migrated to use corresponding com.eclipse.wst.jdt* plug-ins.
