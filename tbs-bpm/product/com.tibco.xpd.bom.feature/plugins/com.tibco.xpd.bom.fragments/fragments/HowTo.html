<h2>How To Contribute Sample Business Object Model Fragments</h2>
<h3>1. Create the fragments:</h3>
<ol compact="compact" type="a">
	<li>For each sample fragment create a BOM model and create the
	"fragment" (the contents of the Model will be converted to a fragment).
	The Model's name and description will be used as the fragment's name
	and description respectively.</li>
	<li>Externalize the model: open the BOM model in the UML editor
	and use the menu option <i>UML Editor->Externalize->Labels</i>. This
	will create a properties file at the same location as the BOM model.
	Notice that Model description will not be externalized and neither will
	any Association names. The properties files can be updated with
	Association labels manually if localization of Associations is required
	(following the key structure in the properties file). To externalize
	the description of the Model add a key with the prefix "_shortdesc"
	(alongside the "_label" entry) for the model.</li>
</ol>
<h3>2. Update this plug-in with the sample fragments:</h3>
<ol compact="compact" type="a">
	<li>Copy the created BOM models and their corresponding properties
	files into the <i>fragments</i> folder in this plug-in (or any other folder
	in the plug-in, but this folder is recommended for clarity). <b>NOTE:</b>
	Sub-folders should be created for every sample fragment category.</li>
	<li>Extend private extension point <code>com.tibco.xpd.bom.fragments.bomFragment</code>
	for each sample category. The extension will require the name and
	description of the category - this will appear in the fragments view -
	and also the location of the category contribution. The extension will
	read the contents of the folder and create fragments for each .bom file
	found.</li>
	<li>Update the Fragments contributor's version number to indicate,
	to the fragments controller, that new sample fragments are available
	(see <code>BOMFragmentsContributor.getFragmentVersion)</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. Localization of the fragments:</h3>
<ol compact="compact" type="a">
	<li>The standard Eclipse localization method of properties should
	be followed, ie create language specific files such as
	fragment1_fr.properties, etc. Plug-in fragments are also supported by the
	fragment localization system.</li>
</ol>

build.</i></b>
