Note from Tim Stephenson 04 Apr 2008 
------------------------------------
This plugin is provided by the Eclipse Foundation's Orbit project. However as 
far as I can tell this project provides only plugins not features, perhaps 
understandably given that many features will want these third party libraries. 

Given that no other TIBCO project requires this plugin (yet) the most 
appropriate solution appears to be to include it within the BOS feature for 
now at least. In order to work within the constraints of 'Builder' it is 
necessary to place this plugin under source control.
