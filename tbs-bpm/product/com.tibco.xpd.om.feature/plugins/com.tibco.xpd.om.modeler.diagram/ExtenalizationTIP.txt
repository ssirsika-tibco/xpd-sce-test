## Tip: How to facilitate Eclipse string externalization mechanism in GMF generated plug-in. 
## @author Jan Arciuchiewicz

The GMF generate 'messages.properties' on the plug-ins root level, but Eclipse 
externalization mechanism expect it to be on the class path.
The outcome is that standard externalization mechanism doesn't work in design time.
If you do a lot of externalization you can: 
 1. Copy 'messages.properties' to the '/src' folder. 
 2. Use Eclipse externalization support to externalize strings.
 3. Copy over modified 'messages.properties' back from '/src' folder to the plug-in's root.
 4. Remove 'messages.properties' from '/src' folder.
