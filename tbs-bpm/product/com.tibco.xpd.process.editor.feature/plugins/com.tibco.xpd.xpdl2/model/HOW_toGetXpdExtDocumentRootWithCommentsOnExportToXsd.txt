DocumentRoot in Extension schema is not normally created as an element when XpdExtension.genmodel is Export Mode -> XML Schema.

This is because it has no MetaData->name attribute value.

If it does not have one then it is not output to schema.

However IF you have one then it blows the model away at runtime.

So to get it included in schema (along with the child elements and their comments...

- TEMPORARILY Set the metadata->name attribute of DocumentRoot to "DocumentRoot" in the ecore file.

- Right click .genmodel, Export Model...,  XML Schema.

== The xsd will have documentRoot elemnet with all the potential top level children that 
  can be added to XPDL elements

- NOW revert the .ecore file.
  
Note : There is one other issue in some naming of elements in ecore which causes issues  
  You must manually edit the produced schema to remove the invalid ":" from the name of the following entries.
    -   <xsd:attribute ecore:name="xMLNSPrefixMap" ecore:reference="ecore:EStringToStringMapEntry" ecore:transient="true" name="xmlns:prefix" type="xsd:IDREFS"/>
    -   <xsd:attribute ecore:name="xSISchemaLocation" ecore:reference="ecore:EStringToStringMapEntry" ecore:transient="true" name="xsi:schemaLocation" type="xsd:IDREFS"/>
