TIBCO Software Inc. End User License Agreement

READ THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. BY 
DOWNLOADING OR INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE 
TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO 
THESE TERMS, DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR INSTALL THE 
SOFTWARE AND RETURN IT TO THE VENDOR FROM WHICH IT 
WAS PURCHASED. RETURNS BY THE ORIGINAL PURCHASER 
WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF THE PURCHASE DATE WILL 
RECEIVE A FULL REFUND.

Upon your acceptance as indicated above, the following shall govern 
your use of the Software except to the extent all or any portion of the 
Software (a) is subject to a separate written agreement, (b) includes a 
separate "click-on" license agreement as part of the download or 
installation process, or (c) is provided by a third party under the terms 
set forth in an Addenda at the end of this Agreement, in which case 
the terms of such addenda shall control over inconsistent terms with 
regard to such portion(s).

License Grant. The Software is the property of TIBCO or its licensors 
and is protected by copyright and other laws. While TIBCO continues 
to own the Software, TIBCO hereby grants to Customer a limited, 
non-transferable, non-exclusive, license to use the number of 
Permitted Instances set forth in the Ordering Document, in 
machine-readable, object code form and solely for Customer's internal 
business use.

Restrictions. Customer agrees not to (a) make more copies than the 
number of Permitted Instances plus a reasonable number of backups; 
(b) provide access to the Software to anyone other than employees, 
contractors, or consultants of Customer; (c) sublicense, transfer, 
assign, distribute to any third party, pledge, lease, rent, or 
commercially share the Software or any of Customer's rights under 
this Agreement (for the purposes of the foregoing a change in control 
of Licensee is deemed to be an assignment); (d) use the Software for 
purposes of providing a service bureau, including, without limitation, 
providing third-party hosting, or third-party application integration or 
application service provider-type services, or any similar services; (e) 
use the Software in connection with ultrahazardous activities, or any 
activity for which failure of the Software might result in death or 
serious bodily injury to Customer or a third party; or (f) directly or 
indirectly, in whole or in part, modify, translate, reverse engineer, 
decrypt, decompile, disassemble, make error corrections to, create 
derivative works based on, or otherwise attempt to discover the 
source code or underlying ideas or algorithms of the Software. 

Beta and Evaluation Licenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the 
Software is being provided for demonstration, beta testing, or 
evaluation purposes, then Customer agrees (a) to use the Software 
solely for such purposes, (b) that the Software will not be used or 
deployed in a production environment, and (c) that such use shall 
automatically terminate upon the earlier of thirty days from the date 
Customer receives the right to install the Software, or Customer's 
receipt of notice of termination from TIBCO.

Technical Support. Provided Customer has paid applicable support 
fees (not included with Software fees unless separately listed), TIBCO 
shall provide support for generally available TIBCO Software on an 
annual basis commencing on the Purchase Date, as follows 
("Support"): Customer shall designate at TIBCO's support website 
https://support.tibco.com/eSupport/newuser.html, the number of 
technical support contacts permitted under the level of Support 
purchased (contacts are changeable upon 48-hours prior written 
notice to TIBCO). Each contact may contact TIBCO for problem 
resolution during TIBCO's published support hours corresponding to 
the level of Support fees paid. 

Upon notice from a contact of a Software problem which can be 
reproduced at a TIBCO support facility or via remote access to 
Customer's facility, TIBCO shall use reasonable efforts to correct or 
circumvent the problem according to its published support objectives. 
TIBCO reserves the right to make changes only to the most currently 
available version. TIBCO will use reasonable efforts to support the 
previously released version of the Software for a maximum of six 
months. 

TIBCO shall have no obligation to support the Software (i) for use on 
any computer system running other than the operating system 
software for which the Software is approved (as set forth in the 
Software documentation) and licensed hereunder, or (ii) if Customer 
has modified or authorized a third party to modify the Software.  
TIBCO shall have no obligation to modify any version of the Software 
to run with any new versions of any operating system, or any other 
third party software or hardware. If Customer purchases Support for 
any Software, Customer must purchase the same level of Support for 
all copies of the Software for which it is licensed. 

Support may be extended for one-year periods on the anniversary of 
each Purchase Date at the standard amounts set forth in its price list, 
for as long as TIBCO offers Support. Customer may reinstate lapsed 
support for any then currently supported Software by paying all 
Support fees in arrears and any applicable reinstatement fee. 
Upgrades, patches, enhancements, bug fixes, new versions and/or 
new releases of the Software provided from time to time under 
Support shall be used only as replacements to existing Permitted 
Instances, and shall not be deemed to increase that number, and use 
thereof shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement, except for 
the first paragraph of the Limited Warranty and any right of return or 
refund.

Consulting Services. Customer may request additional services 
("Services") either in an Ordering Document, or by a separate 
mutually executed work order, statement of work or other 
work-request document incorporating this Agreement (each, a "Work 
Order"). Unless otherwise expressly agreed to in a Work Order, all 
Services and any work product therefrom shall be (a) performed on a 
time and materials basis, plus meals, lodging, travel, and other 
expenses reasonably incurred in connection therewith, (b) deemed 
accepted upon delivery, and (c) exclusively owned by TIBCO (except 
for confidential information of Customer identified to TIBCO in the 
Ordering Document), including all right, title and intellectual property 
or other right or interest therein. Each Work Order is intended to 
constitute an independent and distinct agreement of the parties, 
notwithstanding that each shall be construed to incorporate all 
applicable provisions of this Agreement. Specific to TIBCO training 
services, additional information regarding courses, registration, 
restrictions or limitation can be found at TIBCO's website at 
http://www.tibco.com/services/education under Education Programs.  
Fees for Services shall be due and payable in United States dollars 
net 30 from the date of TIBCO's invoice.

Limited Warranty. If Customer obtained the Software directly from 
TIBCO, then TIBCO warrants that for a period of thirty (30) days from 
the Purchase Date: (i) the media on which the Software is furnished 
will be free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal 
use; and (ii) the Software will substantially conform to its published 
specifications. This limited warranty extends only to the original 
Customer hereunder. Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and the 
entire liability of TIBCO and its suppliers under this limited warranty 
will be, at TIBCO's option, repair, replacement, or refund of the 
Software and applicable Support fees, in which event this Agreement 
shall terminate upon payment thereof.

This warranty does not apply to any Software which (a) is licensed for 
beta, evaluation, testing or demonstration purposes for which TIBCO 
does not receive a license fee, (b) has been altered or modified, 
except by TIBCO, (c) has not been installed, operated, repaired, or 
maintained in accordance with instructions supplied by TIBCO, (d) has 
been subjected to abnormal physical or electrical stress, misuse, 
negligence, or accident, or (e) is used in violation of any other term of 
this Agreement. Customer agrees to pay TIBCO for any Support or 
Services provided by TIBCO related to a breach of the foregoing on a 
time, materials, travel, lodging and other reasonable expenses basis. 
If Customer obtained the Software from a TIBCO reseller or 
distributor, the terms of any warranty shall be as provided by such 
reseller or distributor, and TIBCO provides Customer no warranty with 
respect to such Software.

EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN THIS LIMITED WARRANTY, THE 
SOFTWARE, SUPPORT AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", 
ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, 
AND WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY 
IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, 
SATISFACTORY QUALITY OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF 
DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE, ARE HEREBY 
EXCLUDED TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 
NO WARRANTY IS MADE REGARDING THE RESULTS OF ANY 
SOFTWARE, SUPPORT OR SERVICES OR THAT THE SOFTWARE 
WILL OPERATE WITHOUT ERRORS, PROBLEMS OR 
INTERRUPTIONS, OR THAT ERRORS OR BUGS IN THE 
SOFTWARE WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE SOFTWARE'S 
FUNCTIONALITY OR SERVICES WILL MEET CUSTOMER'S 
REQUIREMENTS. NO TIBCO DEALER, DISTRIBUTOR, AGENT OR 
EMPLOYEE IS AUTHORIZED TO MAKE ANY MODIFICATIONS, 
EXTENSIONS OR ADDITIONS TO THIS WARRANTY.

Indemnity. If Customer obtained the Software from TIBCO directly, 
then TIBCO shall indemnify Licensee from and against any final 
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction, including reasonable 
attorneys' fees, that the unmodified TIBCO Software infringes any 
patent issued by the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, or any 
member of the European Union, or any copyright, or any trade secret 
of a third party; provided that TIBCO is promptly notified in writing of 
such claim, TIBCO has the exclusive right to control such defense 
and/or settlement, and Licensee shall provide reasonable assistance 
(at TIBCO's expense) in the defense thereof. In no event shall 
Licensee settle any claim, action or proceeding without TIBCO's prior 
written approval. In the event of any such claim, litigation or threat 
thereof, TIBCO, at its sole option and expense, shall (a) procure for 
Licensee the right to continue to use the TIBCO Software or (b) 
replace or modify the TIBCO Software with functionally equivalent 
software. If such settlement or modification is not commercially 
reasonable (in the reasonable opinion of TIBCO), TIBCO may cancel 
this Agreement upon sixty days prior written notice to Licensee, and 
refund to Licensee the unamortized portion of the license fees paid to 
TIBCO by Licensee based on a five-year straight-line depreciation. 
This Section states the entire liability of TIBCO with respect to the 
infringement of any Intellectual Property rights, and Licensee hereby 
expressly waives any other liabilities or obligations of TIBCO with 
respect thereto. The foregoing indemnity shall not apply to the extent 
any infringement could have been avoided by use of the then-current 
release.

Limitation of Liability.  EXCEPT AS PROVIDED UNDER 
INDEMNITY OR RESULTING FROM  A BREACH OF 
CONFIDENTIALITY (THE "EXCLUDED MATTERS"), IN NO EVENT 
WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST DATA, LOST 
REVENUE, LOST PROFITS, DAMAGE TO REPUTATION, 
BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, 
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, 
EXEMPLARY OR ANY SIMILAR TYPE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF 
THIS AGREEMENT, THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE 
SOFTWARE, OR THE PROVISION OF ANY SUPPORT OR 
SERVICES, EVEN IF A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. EXCEPT FOR THE 
EXCLUDED MATTERS, IN NO EVENT SHALL A PARTY BE LIABLE 
TO THE OTHER, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING 
ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF WARRANTY, 
CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE 
PRICE PAID BY CUSTOMER UNDER THE APPLICABLE 
ORDERING DOCUMENT. 

THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY EVEN IF THE 
ABOVE-STATED REMEDY OR LIMITED WARRANTY FAILS OF ITS 
ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR 
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF 
CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE 
LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO CUSTOMER.

Confidentiality. "Confidential Information" means the terms of this 
Agreement; all information marked by the disclosing party as 
proprietary or confidential; any provided software, related 
documentation or related performance test results derived by 
Licensee; and any methods, concepts or processes utilized in 
provided software or related documentation. Confidential Information 
shall remain the sole property of the disclosing party and shall not be 
disclosed to any non-Authorized User without the prior written consent 
of the disclosing party. If Confidential Information is communicated 
orally, such communication shall be confirmed as "Confidential" in 
writing within thirty days of such disclosure. The parties agree to 
protect the Confidential Information of the other in the same manner it 
protects the confidentiality of similar information and data of its own 
(and at all times exercising at least a reasonable degree of care). 
Except with respect to the Software, items will not be deemed 
Confidential Information if (i) available to the public other than by a 
breach of an agreement with TIBCO, (ii) rightfully received from a third 
party not in breach of any obligation of confidentiality, (iii) 
independently developed by one party without use of the Confidential 
Information of the other; (iv) known to the recipient at the time of 
disclosure (other than under a separate confidentiality obligation); or 
(v) produced in compliance with applicable law or court order, 
provided the other party is given reasonable notice of the same. Both 
parties agree to indemnify the other for any damages the other may 
sustain resulting from their unauthorized use and/or disclosure of the 
other's Confidential Information. Such damages shall include 
reasonable expenses incurred in seeking both legal and equitable 
remedies. To the extent required by law, at Customer's request, 
TIBCO shall provide Customer with the interface information needed 
to achieve interoperability between the Software and another 
independently created program, on payment of TIBCO's applicable 
fee. Customer agrees to observe obligations of confidentiality with 
respect to such information.

Export. Software, including technical data, is subject to U.S. export 
control laws, including the U.S. Export Administration Act and its 
associated regulations, and may be subject to export or import 
regulations in other countries. Customer agrees to comply strictly with 
all such regulations and agrees to obtain all necessary licenses to 
export, re-export, or import Software.

Government Use. If the Customer is an agency, department, or other 
entity of the United States Government ("Government"), the use, 
duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure or transfer 
of the Software, or any related documentation of any kind, including 
technical data or manuals, is restricted in accordance with Federal 
Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") 12.212 for civilian agencies and 
Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement ("DFARS") 
227.7202 for military agencies. The Software is commercial computer 
software and commercial computer software documentation. Use of 
the Software and related documentation by the Government is further 
restricted in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and any 
modification thereto. 

Orders. An Ordering Document shall be deemed accepted only by 
issuance of a TIBCO invoice and solely for purposes of administrative 
convenience. None of the terms of the Ordering Document (other than 
the Software product name, number of Permitted Instances, level of 
Support, description of Services, and fees due in connection 
therewith) shall apply for any reason or purpose whatsoever, 
regardless of any statement on any Ordering Document to the 
contrary, unless countersigned by an officer of TIBCO. This 
Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with 
respect to the use of the Software, Support and Services, and 
supersedes all proposals, oral or written, and all other 
representations, statements, negotiations and undertakings relating to 
the subject matter hereof.  All orders of Software, Support or Services 
by Customer from TIBCO shall be deemed to occur under the terms of 
this Agreement (with or without reference to this Agreement), unless 
expressly superseded by a signed written Agreement between the 
parties.  Software shall be delivered electronically (unless physical 
shipment is specifically set forth in an Ordering Document), and such 
delivery shall occur upon e-mail of download information to Licensee 
at the email address set forth in the Ordering Document or as 
otherwise provided by Customer to TIBCO.  Physical deliveries  (if 
applicable) of Software and documentation which typically 
accompanies the Software on delivery shall be on CD-ROM, FOB 
TIBCO, and delivery shall occur by depositing the CD-ROM with 
TIBCO's overnight carrier (at no charge to Customer).

Term and Termination. Support or Services may be terminated: (a) 
by either party upon a default of the other, such default remaining 
uncured for fifteen days from written notice from the non-defaulting 
party; (b) upon the filing for bankruptcy or insolvency of the other 
party, (c) by either party upon prior written notice at least sixty days 
prior to the end of any annual Maintenance period; or (d) by Licensee 
(for Services), upon ten days prior written notice.  Termination of 
Support or Services shall not terminate this Agreement. Customer 
may terminate this Agreement in its entirety at any time by destroying 
all copies of the Software. Upon termination of this Agreement in its 
entirety, for any reason, Customer must cease using and return or 
destroy all copies of the Software. Customer's obligation to pay 
accrued charges and any fees due as of the date of termination, as 
well as the sections entitled "Confidentiality", "Limited Warranty" and 
"Limitation of Liability" shall survive any such termination. 

Authority. You hereby represent and warrant that you have full power 
and authority to accept the terms of this Agreement on behalf of 
Customer, and that Customer agrees to be bound by this Agreement.

General. Fees on the Ordering Document (all to be paid on the latter 
of thirty days from Invoice by TIBCO or the date set forth in the 
Ordering Document) do not include sales, use, withholding, 
value-added or similar taxes, and Customer agrees to pay the same, 
excluding therefrom taxes related to TIBCO's income and corporate 
franchise tax. Customer agrees to pay all reasonable costs incurred 
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) in collecting past due amounts 
under this Agreement.  Except as set forth in the Section entitled 
"Limited Warranty" all fees paid under or in connection with this 
Agreement are non-refundable and no right of set-off exists. All 
payments of fees due shall be made in U.S. dollars, net 30 from 
Purchase Date, or, for any other amounts coming due hereafter, net 
30 from TIBCO's invoice. A service charge of one and one-half 
percent per month will be applied to all invoices that are not paid on 
time. Licensee agrees to pay all sales, use, value-added, withholding, 
excise and any other similar taxes or government charges, exclusive 
of TIBCO's income taxes. No delay in the performance of any 
obligation by either party, excepting all obligations to make payment, 
shall constitute a breach of this Agreement to the extent caused by 
force majeure. Customer hereby grants TIBCO and its independent 
auditors the right to audit Customer's compliance with this Agreement. 
If any portion of this Agreement is found to be void or unenforceable, 
the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. This 
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with 
the laws of the State of California, United States of America, as if 
performed wholly within the state and without giving effect to the 
principles of conflict of law. The state and/or federal courts in San 
Francisco, California, USA, shall have exclusive jurisdiction of any 
action arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The United Nations 
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is 
excluded from application hereto. If any portion hereof is found to be 
void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement 
shall remain in full force and effect.
