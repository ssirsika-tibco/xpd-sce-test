Decided not to introduce this test yes as it currently (v3.6.0 V18) incurs the following BDS restriction:

WSDL 2.x : BDS cannot process this WSDL as it has problems: XML Schema (http://tibco.com/amx/integration/test/wsdl/porttype) contains unsupported List tag.  (Please see error log for more details.) (/BOMGenTests/Service Descriptors/PortTypeWSDL.wsdl)	PortTypeWSDL.wsdl	/BOMGenTests/Service Descriptors	/	WSDL Problems
