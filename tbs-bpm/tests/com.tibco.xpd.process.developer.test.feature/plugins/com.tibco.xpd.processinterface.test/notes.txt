Notes from meetings on 11th and 16th of Feb 2010
================================================================

1. NCName value errors on WSDLs. 
	NCNames cannot start with numbers. This may need to be a validation rule.
2. Message name for procifc error (faults) aren't set correctly. See "SimpleTypesProcIfcTest.wsdl"
	dStartMsgEventWithError_dStartMsgEventWithError_Error2_fault
3. Unexpected problem markers - Process Manager 1.x : There is no corresponding 
	service defined in the selected WSDL for <> (aProcesswithnoparams:Intmsgwithnoresponse)
	for all the request response activities
4. iProcess - rule for iProcess - message events.
5. NCName - validation for named elements, WSDL creation 
6. Reduce to WARNING Process interface containing events of trigger types Message
	Process interface change wording should "should -- probably--"
	
- Move WSDLComparator to core test util from n2 test
- Move process interface tests incliding their studio projects to process developer test feature.
	Once done, remove the studio projects from extra-stuff.
- New validation rule "If there is a fault for an operation ti must also have OUT parameter".
	Applies to None and Message start events.
- Enhance tests to cover XPD-36 (gold wsdl should have enumeration)
- XPD-38 covered. Will implement the rule then assertions.
- Need test that turns on iProcess destination and checks the validation rules(no WSDL assertions needed). 
	Needs to go in ipm test feature.
- Distribute the WSDL generation changes document.
