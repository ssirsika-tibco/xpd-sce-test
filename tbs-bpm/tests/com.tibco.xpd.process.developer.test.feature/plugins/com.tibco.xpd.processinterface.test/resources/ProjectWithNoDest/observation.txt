Process Modeler
---------------

1. Cannot create process that implements Process 
interface when destination set to one that does not generate WSDLs.
Resolved the NPE, but cannot create processes/packages using the Process Interfaces.

Work on the pre commit listeener to generate triggerresultmessage

3. Problem markers for process interface message events saying there is no purpose with WSDL's 
	being generated.
