This folder should save the .maa files created by a test. So after execution of a test we simply save the maa file
to this location so that the next test can be run easily and does not bring up dialogs saying
"The projects is not saved, do you want to save it". Refer to the procedure 'temporarySaveMaaFile'
in the util test AnalystUtil for details. 
So this folder should always remain empty.
